Overview
These Project was amazing! I learned a lot. I had to evaluate the API Explorer, Python CLient Libary, Developer Sandbox, Developer Admin Page and the Documentation.

For Extrnal resources, I had to use Stackoverflow & 1 intersting blog.

I had one concern:
- was there a need to use one of the client Libarys?
- Was the point of this challange to see if i can use and refactor the python Launcher application?
- is it ok that I just used the API Expolor?


My Diecion
I desided to go with the easyest route and only use the API explore
